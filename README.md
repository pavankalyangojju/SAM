# SAM(Smart Agriculture Machine)
## OVERVIEW :-
Machine is used for the security of silkworms it is helpful to reduce the
challenges in sericulture, By monitoring the Humidity Temperature and
Poisonous gasses, which affect the silkworm.
## PROBLEM STATEMENT:-
In the present scenario of sericulture Silk worms are kept in such places
where the humidity levels and temperature levels are not monitored There will
be a high chances of fluctuation which may leads to death of silkmoth (this is the
last stage of crop) This will be a huge loss to farmer ,
## Solution:-
As a person who born and brought up in village , i have seen this problem and
came with a solution to solve this problem With the help of components like temperature
sensor , humidity sensor Raspberry pi , blynk server, cloud server etc created a
equipment called as SAM(smart agriculture machine) which monitor the temperature
and humidity level according to the standards set primarily , Which also sense the
poisonous gas that can affect the silkworm,The input given by sensors will be processed by raspberry pi , and alerts if the
standards set is crossed sends the data through a smart phone to users , and the same
data will be stored in blynk server
(output will be shown in )
